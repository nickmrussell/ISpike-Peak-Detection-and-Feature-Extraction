### The original script is adapted from the 21 sweeps detection code written by Daniel Anthony San Miguel Jr.
### Daniel Anthony San Miguel Jr., Doctoral Cannidate at University of Austin
### in Dr. Jennifer Donegan's lab.
### The code has since been modified by my team: Turner Lime and Regina Mangieri, PhD.
### I have modified the code back to Daniel's version for 10 kHz sampling instead of 20 kHz
### 
###
### Alterations made by TJL and RAM include: 
###  - Changing dV/dT filter from 10 to 20
###  - Reduced 'Threshold time (ms)' detection window from (-15) -> (-1.2) (delta time from AP)
###  - Reduced fastAHP detection window from ['Threshold Time(ms)' + 15] -> ['Threshold Time(ms)' + 5]
### 
### I (NMR) have added the following changes to accomodate my files:
### 
###
###!!! Additional Data Note !!!
### Upon completion of data processing using this code:
###  Double-check files with maxAHP delta time close or equal to 15 ms AND sAHP delta more negative than -25 mV
###  These files may contain sweeps where the first action potential is too close to the end of the current step
### ^I (NMR) am currently trying to fix this, please keep up to date for when I finally get it,
### There is a chance some of the interneurons I collected would not do well with this change so idk yet
